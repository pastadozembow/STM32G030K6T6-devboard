This board was designed to be as cheap as possible while remaining fast and flexible to use. It can be powered by a 12v source via the vin pin, It has a 64mhz 32bit ARM MCU and can be flashed via an USB port which is connected to an USB to UART converter.
5 boards assembled by hand cost 20$(converted from PLN so it can be cheaper depending on your component source and country)
